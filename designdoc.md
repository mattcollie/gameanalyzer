Deliverable 1: Using a player, record timestamps for multiple different actions.  
**For Example**: *A coach reviewing a rugby game may want to record when the instance of a kick, tackle, scrum... etc occurs. Because coaches may have a different number of actions that they want to do record, **the number and names** of the actions should be up to the coach, thereby they can choose the number of elements they want to create to allow them to measure their video*  
Deliverable 2: Database, Web API -> C#, Web UI -> C#, ASP.net, Javascript
